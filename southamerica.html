<h4>Guyana, South America. Kaieteur Falls</h4>
<p class="writing2">Kaieteur Falls is the largest single drop waterfall in the world. It is situated on the Potaro River in the Kaieteur National Park, in an area of the Amazon rainforest known as the Potaro-Siparuni region of Guyana. The drop over a sandstone and conglomerate cliff to the first break is 226 metres (741 feet) high. It then flows over a series of steep cascades, which, when measured, bring the total height to 251 metres (822 ft). While many falls have greater height, few have the combination of height and water volume, and Kaieteur is one of the world's most powerful waterfalls, with an average flow rate of 663 cubic meters per second (23,400 cubic feet per second).</p>

<h4>Perito Moreno glacier, El Calafate, Patagonia Argentina</h4>
<p class="writing2">The Perito Moreno Glacier (Spanish: Glaciar Perito Moreno) is a glacier in the Los Glaciares National Park in Argentina's southwest Santa Cruz Province. It is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Argentina's Patagonia. The 250 km2 (97 sq mi) ice formation, 30 km (19 mi) in length, is one of 48 glaciers fed by the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, which is part of Chile's Andes system. This ice field is the world's third largest fresh water reserve.</p>

<h4>Bush Dog</h4>
<p class="writing2">The bush dog (Speothos venaticus) is a breed of dog native to Central and South America. [1][2] Despite its extensive range, it is very rare in most areas except Suriname, Guyana, and Peru;[2][4] it was first identified from fossils in Brazilian caves by Peter Wilhelm Lund and was thought to be extinct. [4] The bush dog is the only living species in the genus Speothos,[1] and genetic evidence suggests that it is related to the maned wolf of central South America[5] or the African wild dog. [6] The IUCN classifies the species as Near Threatened.</p>
