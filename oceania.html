<h4>Polar Bear</h4>
<p class="writing2">The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a hypercarnivorous bear that lives primarily within the Arctic Circle and in the Arctic Ocean. The polar bear is classified as a vulnerable species due to the habitat loss caused by climate change. For decades, large-scale hunting raised international concern about the species' future, but populations recovered after controls and quotas were implemented. Polar bears have been an important part of circumpolar peoples' material, spiritual, and cultural lives for thousands of years, and they continue to be so today. The polar bear was previously known as the "white bear." It is also known as the "nanook," after the Inuit term nanuq.</p>

<h4>Emperor Penguins</h4>
<p class="writing2">The emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) is the tallest and heaviest penguin species and is only found in Antarctica. The IUCN upgraded the emperor penguin from least concern to near threatened in 2012. It is currently being considered for listing under the US Endangered Species Act, along with nine other penguin species. The primary causes of increased species endangerment are declining food availability as a result of climate change and industrial fisheries on crustacean and fish populations. Disease, habitat destruction, and human disturbance at breeding colonies are also reasons for the species' inclusion on the Endangered Species Act list. The impact of tourism is particularly concerning.</p>

<h4>Antarctica</h4>
<p class="writing2">The Antarctic Peninsula was the fastest-warming place on Earth in the second half of the twentieth century, closely followed by West Antarctica, but temperatures rose more slowly in the early twenty-first century. In contrast, the South Pole in East Antarctica barely warmed during much of the twentieth century, but temperatures rose three times faster than the global average between 1990 and 2020. The continent recorded its highest temperature of 18.3 째C (64.9 째F) in February 2020, which was 0.8 째C (1.4 째F) higher than the previous record set in March 2015. There is some evidence that surface warming in Antarctica is caused by human greenhouse gas emissions, but determining this due to internal variability is difficult.</p>
