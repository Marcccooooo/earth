<h4>Snow Monkeys</h4>
<p class="writing2">The Japanese macaque (Macaca fuscata), also known as the snow monkey, is a species of terrestrial Old World monkey indigenous to Japan. Slash-and-burn agriculture, the use of forest woods for construction and fuel, and hunting are all traditional human behaviors that pose a threat to macaques. Due to social and economic changes in Japan since World War II, these threats have decreased, but new threats have emerged. The most serious threat is the replacement of natural forests with lumber plantations. Macaques have lost their fear of humans as human prosperity has increased, and they can now be found in both rural and urban areas, with one macaque living in central Tokyo for several months.</p>

<h4>Asian Golden Cat</h4>
<p class="writing2">The Asian golden cat is a medium-sized wild cat that weighs between 25 and 35 pounds. Its average length, including the tail, is about 4 feet. The Asian golden cat ranges from Southeast Asia's lowlands to the Himalayas, sometimes reaching altitudes of 3,000 meters. Parts of Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand, and Vietnam are included in its range. The Asian golden cat is listed as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). The Asian golden cat faces threats such as habitat loss due to deforestation, indiscriminate snaring, and illegal trade in its pelt and bones. It is also threatened in Southeast Asia by a decrease in the number of prey animals.</p>

<h4>Sumatran Tiger</h4>
<p class="writing2">Today, the last of Indonesia's tigers—fewer than 400—are clinging to life in the island of Sumatra's remaining patches of forest. Because of accelerating deforestation and rampant poaching, this noble creature may become extinct like its extinct Javan and Balinese relatives. Sumatran tigers are the smallest surviving tiger subspecies, distinguished by their orange coats with thick black stripes. In Indonesia, they are legally protected, with harsh penalties such as jail time and steep fines. Despite increased efforts in tiger conservation, including increased law enforcement and antipoaching capacity, a significant market for tiger parts and products remains in Sumatra and the rest of Asia. Sumatran tigers are rapidly losing habitat and prey, and poaching shows no signs of abating.</p>
