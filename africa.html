<h4>Lilac-breasted Roller</h4>
<p class="writing2">The lilac-breasted roller (Coracias caudatus) is a species of African roller in the Coraciidae family. It is found throughout Sub-Saharan Africa and is a stray in the southern Arabian Peninsula. [1] It prefers open woodland and savanna and is mostly absent from treeless areas. It perches conspicuously at the tops of trees, poles, or other high vantage points from which it can spot insects, lizards, scorpions, snails, small birds, and rodents moving around on the ground.</p>

<h4>The Five Male Cheetahs</h4>
<p class="writing2">The cheetah lives in a variety of habitats, including Serengeti savannahs, arid Sahara mountain ranges, and hilly desert terrain in Iran. Several factors endanger the cheetah, including habitat loss, conflict with humans, poaching, and a high susceptibility to disease. The cheetah, which once roamed most of Sub-Saharan Africa and eastward into the Middle East and central India, is now found primarily in small, fragmented populations in central Iran and southern, eastern, and northwestern Africa. The global cheetah population was estimated to be 7,100 individuals in the wild in 2016, and it is classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. Cheetahs were once tamed and trained to hunt ungulates.</p>

<h4>The White Rhinoceros</h4>
<p class="writing2">The white rhinoceros, also known as the white rhino or square-lipped rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum), is the largest extant rhinoceros species. It has the most social of all rhino species and has a large mouth for grazing. The white rhinoceros is divided into two subspecies: the southern white rhinoceros, which had an estimated population of 19,682-21,077 wild animals in 2015, and the much rarer northern white rhinoceros. The northern subspecies has only two confirmed individuals left in 2018 (two females: Fatu, 18 and Najin, 29), both in captivity. Sudan, the world's last known male northern white rhinoceros, died on March 19, 2018 in Kenya.</p>
